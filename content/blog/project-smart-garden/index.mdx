## 1. Why

Fresh homegrown tomatoes are very tasty, so building a raised bed to grow them is a no brainer. However, as I also enjoy using different kinds of technologies 
and I like to automate things, it was not far-fetched to reduce the *tremendous* effort *(/irony off)* to grow the plants with some smart things. Exploring technologies with 
such simple use cases is always a great way to learn and understand them better. 

This is the simple plan: 

1. Build raised bed & plant <- ðŸ’¡ Current Step
2. Build automated watering system
3. Monitor plant growth with camera
